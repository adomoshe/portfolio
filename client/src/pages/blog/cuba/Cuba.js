      This past Spring Break I traveled to Cuba, the largest island in the
      Caribbean, home to a rich &nbsp;past filled with revolutions and a strong
      national pride.
      <br />
      <br />
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <b>Important Pre-Departure Information</b>
      </div>
      <br />
      Traveling to Cuba from the U.S. presents some logistical challenges. Until
      recently travel to Cuba was not permitted and visitors had to fly through
      Mexico. Relations with Cuba have been strained since the Cold War until
      Obama lifted some parts of the embargo toward the end of his presidency.
      Flights are now available mostly through various airports in Florida. This
      is still true under Trump, but it does not seem that he is working toward
      further improving relations. At the time of my trip, from March 3rd to the
      11th, in 2017 it was not necessary to get written pre approval from any
      U.S. office or entity, which may be the case now. The State Department has
      issued 12 categories for permitted travel to Cuba, among them journalistic
      activities, which I claimed was the purpose of my trip.
      <br />
      <br />
      Trump's new travel restrictions should not deter those poised for a Cuban
      adventure independent of tour groups. New legislation incentivizes booking
      tour groups to explore Cuba through "People to People" aimed trips, but
      this is not a requirement in order to enter Cuba. Longstanding legislation
      specifies that Americans should not conduct business with entities owned
      by the Cuban military, thus funneling American business toward the newly
      emerging private sector. The biggest worry seems to be lodging, since
      private "casa particulars" (further explained below) seem to provide a
      more genuine and highly recommended experience I would book these ahead of
      time, and save email chains as proof of purchase.
      <br />
      <br />
      In my opinion, these travel categories put in place with the lifting of
      the travel ban are instituted mostly to scare off would-be travelers. Cuba
      has always had a booming tourism industry, the fact that Americans could
      historically not directly travel to this island that's closer to Key West
      than Miami, does not mean Europeans were similarly forbidden. After Obama
      reopened diplomatic relations shortly before leaving office, these
      restrictions seem like a way to phase in travel to Cuba. This seems to be
      an effective way to prevent a swarm of Spring Breakers from overburdening
      the hospitality industry, causing tensions, and abusing the mojito filled
      beaches of Varadero.
      <br />
      <br />
      The first stumbling block to your Cuba trip is merely a figment. A concern
      much more palpable is that until 2015, the Department of State placed Cuba
      on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, alongside Libya, Iraq, South
      Yemen, and Syria. Cuba's 35 year stint on this list has some implications
      directly related to your travels. This means the American government
      prohibits American financial institutions from doing business in these
      countries.&nbsp;
      <b>
        You cannot use your credit or debit card, or any other financial service
        in Cuba. You will only be able to use the hard cash you bring with you!!
      </b>
      &nbsp;This is the most important thing to remember and plan for, so bring
      more money than you think you will need because converting it back is a
      lot easier than trying to figure out how to survive in a foreign country
      without any money. This also means that you will be carrying a few hundred
      to several thousand dollars worth of Cuban Convertible Pesos around. For
      this reason, and in general for any travel you embark on, I would strongly
      recommend buying a money belt, money sock, or both. I purchased both from
      Amazon before departing. I spread out my cash between my money sock, money
      belt, backpack, and left some in the casa particular I was staying in.
      Another very important piece of information concerns the exchange rates.
      Cuba charges a 10% conversion fee exclusively on USD, meaning that when
      you exchange $100, $10 will be take off the top. You also cannot preorder
      CUC from your local bank, relating back to the whole state sponsor of
      terrorism business. Ironically, the CUC is pegged to the USD, so when
      looking at prices online just remember that whatever you do you are not
      going to get more than around 85 cents on the dollar when converting
      (accounting for other exchange fees).{' '}
      <b>
        You can only convert your cash in Cuba, meaning you do not want to
        forget to convert all of your money back before leaving, because there
        is a good chance it could be worthless when you return, as no place in
        the U.S. will offer to exchange it.
      </b>{' '}
      What many recommend to do and what I also ended up doing is ordering Euro
      from my bank and bringing that to Cuba, since other currencies are not
      subject to the 10% fee. This ended up saving me a few bucks, so I would
      recommend checking exchange rates to validate the efficacy of this
      solution.
      <br />
      <br />
      Another important thing to remember concerning cash is that Cuba has two
      currencies, the Convertible Cuban Peso (CUC) which is linked to the
      American dollar as discussed above, and is used exclusively by tourists.
      As well as the (CUP) Cuban Peso which is used by locals. The conversion is
      around 25 CUP to CUC, so confusing prices is difficult, if it seems too
      high its most likely in CUP.
      <br />
      <br />
      Unless you can really pull off the Cuban look and ditch that neck anchor
      of a DSLR you're carrying around, chances are you will quickly be
      identified as a tourist and subject to the CUC prices. This will only
      really affect you at museums, where entrance fee is typically 2 CUP for
      locals and 2 CUC for tourists, this seems like a great disparity but
      considering that locals rake in less than $100 a month after taxes and
      government programs, this disparity suddenly comes into perspective.
      <br />
      <br />
      As for phone service on the island, carriers are also not allowed to
      conduct business in Cuba so you can forget about your snap streaks. The
      only way to get an internet connection is to buy a Tarjeta Propia at
      ETECSA or from local kids on the street and you can access wifi at various
      areas throughout the city.

        <b>Arrival</b>
      </div>
      <br />A taxi ride from Jose Marti International Airport to downtown Havana
      is a little pricy at around 30 CUC; it is approximately a thirty minute
      ride. Once you arrive you quickly see that the streets of Havana are just
      as advertised, filled with classic cars from the 50s. For the traveler not
      seeking to stray too far off the beaten path, Cuba offers upscale,
      comfortable accommodation in the most popular parts of old Havana, you can
      even stay in the Hotel Ambos Mundos where Hemingway famously stayed. Or,
      you can simply visit Hemingway's room in your free time in the city and
      opt for a stay in what are known as "Casa Particulars". Under Raul
      Castro's leadership some small capitalistic opportunities have emerged,
      such as opening privately owned stores to sell art, tourist eye candy,
      among others. Citizens can now rent out spare bedrooms to tourists, the
      tourist stays in the local's private home, so there is an expectation of
      mutual respect. Of course, this doesn't mean you can't go out at night,
      but just be considerate when coming back. These typically run for about
      20-35 CUC a night, depending on location and amenities. I stayed with a
      very welcoming and friendly host. She only spoke Spanish, but others do
      also speak English, I booked the Casa through Lisbeth (who speaks English)
      at <b>barque15@gmail.com</b>. She was booked for my dates but referred me
      to a friend that had occupancy then. I stayed with her for my full trip.

      Since my casa particular was on the outskirts of the most touristy areas
      in the city, restaurants nearby serviced mostly locals. What they lacked
      in curb appeal they more that compensated for in taste. As for the price,
      it seemed a little high, at around 20-25 so I was not sure in which
      currency. But, I gladly discovered it to be in CUP. Since I did not carry
      any CUP on me I was charged 1.5 CUC, the equivalent of about $2 after
      exchange rates, knowing I would be back, I paid a greatly appreciative
      waiter with a 3 CUC coin.

      In general, Cuba is not known for its cuisine, this is due to the
      historical lack of readily available ingredients and spices as Cuba
      struggled from a weak economy and declines in demand for its main export,
      sugar cane. Remaining Communist in a post Soviet world proves difficult
      for Cuba, which faces an American embargo that not only restricts American
      trade with the island but trade with freight ships that have recently
      docked in Cuba. This leaves Cuba with a limited list of trade partners.
      Historically, the Soviet Union topped the list, even provided free
      supplies and aid during Cuba's military alliance and the ensuing Cuban
      Missile Crisis. Later, Fidel and Hugo's friendship blossomed into a
      thriving trade relationship between Cuba and Venezuela; while China has
      always maintained a high rank on that list of trading partners. Otherwise,
      they are not too popular as far as international trade. I would recommend
      reading up on some of Cuba's history before departing, I really enjoyed
      the Netflix series, "The Cuba Libre Story" and any credible information I
      found online.

      Anything found outside Old Havana will probably be on the cheaper end
      while still offering hearty meals. I did get food poisoning once on the
      trip, coming back from Cienfuegos, really not much you can do to avoid bad
      food just carry Advil on you and be ready. Touristy restaurants are just
      what you would expect at the prices you would expect. Service at both can
      be spotty since Cuban dining is European style and not accustomed to
      tipping. This is especially the case with state run restaurants as opposed
      to the "Paladares" which are privately owned, and more motivated to make a
      profit. Spotting the differences between the two seems impossible until it
      dawns on you that you have been waiting for the waiter to walk by and hand
      out menus for the past thirty minutes and you realize its a state run
      spot. My only experience with this situation was at Plaza de Armas in Old
      Havana where after admiring the view for a long while, a group of older
      ladies informed me that I was going to have to be much more proactive
      throughout this dining experience. Other restaurants were crowded and I
      had already secured a nice table outside, so I decided to get out my
      wallet and head to the bar. Paying at the bar and adding a generous tip
      seemed to correct the situation and I was quickly enjoying my Cigar and
      Empanada meal.

      Fabrica de Arte Cubano was highly rated and after going twice, I would
      rate as a must. The building looks like a warehouse from outside, and
      offers an incredible mix between an art gallery and a nightclub. Featuring
      a large main stage and another smaller dance floor, as well as multiple
      bars throughout, and even a restaurant. Alcohol is reasonably priced and
      the art is interesting, especially after a few drinks. Drinks are not paid
      for at the bar, rather, each entrant receives a card that is stamped with
      the price of the drink each time one is served, and must be paid for when
      exiting. Losing this card will cost 30 CUC. Another thing to watch out for
      are local women that seem a little too friendly, they may be on the clock.

      On my second night, Dutch guests staying at the same apartment building as
      my casa graciously invited me out to Teatro Mella for the annual Fiesta
      Del Tambor. One of the Dutch guests was a dance instructor in the
      Netherlands and took the other, one of her students, with her to
      appreciate the culture in which the dances they learned originated. The
      instructor had visited Cuba many times before and introduced us to a local
      she got to know pretty well. The show started with an intricate display of
      singing and dancing in the lobby, until we moved into the theater for the
      main performance.

        I also want to mention the benefits of organized travel. Most hotels in
        Old Havana have an area for trip organizers to set up and display the
        various trips or activities they offer. I went on an overnight trip to
        Cienfuegos and Trinidad which is about a 4 hour drive from Havana. This
        trip cost 150 CUC and was well worth it. We received breakfast lunch and
        dinner both days, stayed the night at a quaint spot in the mountains,
        and had guided tours in the cities. I would recommend this option if you
        want to get out of Havana for a while, they also do day trips and other
        activities. If you are traveling alone this is also a great way to meet
        other travelers.&nbsp;

      Cuba was an absolute blast and I would highly recommend visiting. It is
      not the typical touristy destination, it is very affordable and and offers
      many spots to visit besides Havana. You can really tailor your trip to
      your comfort level, you can visit different parts of the island or you can
      opt to stay in Havana or even relax at an all inclusive in Varadero for a
      while.
